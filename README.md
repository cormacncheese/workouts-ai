Use the Stripe CLI to test webhooks

Install the Stripe CLI and link your Stripe account.

Next, start local webhook forwarding:

```
stripe listen --forward-to=localhost:3000/api/webhooks
```

Running this Stripe command will print a webhook secret (such as, whsec\_\*\*\*) to the console. Set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET to this value in your .env.local file.

Ngrok (ignore this for now)

```
ngrok http --domain=devmaia.com 3000
```
